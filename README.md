# Hello there! 
We're looking for an editor who can bring creative vision + ideas to the kitbogashow team. 

Our hope, is to find someone who can review "rough" footage and come up with some direction for it:
- what would the focus of the edit be?
- how would you end it
- what things might you "insert" into the edit (post)
- what might you title it

If you are interested we are looking for someone to review this call:

email stuff here:
hello@kitbogashow.com 

You don't need to edit the entire call, but if you can show some examples of your editing or a short edit of this call that'd be fine. 
Mostly looking to see what kind of "vision" you can bring.
